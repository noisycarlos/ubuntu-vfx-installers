# VFX Installers for Ubuntu #

This repository contains scripts to install Nuke, Resolve, and Fusion. These programs are commonly used in Visual Effects and post-production. However they're not particularly easy to install in Linux because they're not distributed as standard Linux installer files (deb, rpm, flatpak, etc).

## Instructions ##

## Step 1 ##
Download or clone this repository wherever you wish, for example your Downloads directory.
## Step 2 ##
Download the Linux installers for the apps you wish to install from their respective websites. You don't need to download all the installers, just the ones you need.
- [Nuke](https://www.foundry.com/products/nuke/download)
- Resolve
- Fusion
## Step 3 ##
Unzip the downloaded files and place the installers with a .run extension inside this repository, next to the scripts.
## Step 4 ##
If you wish to install all the programs at once, run the install-all script (it will only install the apps for which you placed an installer). 

Otherwise, use the individual script for each application.
